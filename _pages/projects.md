## Codeforces Problem Tracker Chrome Extension

Created a chrome extension which keeps track of your understood but not yet implemented problems of codeforces and colors those problems as yellow.
- Used chrome storage api to keep track of the problems.
- Created a frontend using HTML + CSS to display the understood problems.
- Got 14 upvotes and good feedback from the codeforces community regarding this extension.
